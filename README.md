## About me
I'm LittleTykha, but you may call me Tykha. I'm a 29-year old student whose field of study is networking.

What can be said about me... I'm an Otaku. I like pretty much everything related to the anime culture! I also have an ever-growing interest over technologies, especially AI.

For a long time, I've been wondering how AI worked, was made, and I've always thought it would be awesome to learn about it. So I decided it was time to set a goal for myself, which led to my current personnal project: I aim to create my own "small" Large Language Model from scratch, which I will use to deepen my comprehension on AI... and probably for entertainement too.

I am aware this is not a mere task, and that it is going to be a long journey. I first have to learn how to code, then learn how LLMs work. This might take years to achieve, but I'm confident that if I put one step at a time, then I'll reach the end of the road. Moreover, I may discover new interests along the way!

This is where my AI journey begins. Feel free to follow my progress or to support me with advice or learning ressources.

Until then 👋

Tykha
